Title of the Experiment: Collect, Clean, Integrate, and Transform Healthcare Data Based on a Specific Disease.

Objectives: To implement the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline on a disease-specific healthcare dataset (e.g., diabetes) and perform the following operations:

Data Collection

Data Cleaning

Data Integration (optional for multi-source data)

Data Transformation

Theory: In healthcare analytics, raw data is often messy, incomplete, or spread across different sources. Before analysis or machine learning can be applied, this data must go through a pipeline that includes:

a. Data Collection

This is the process of gathering data from primary or secondary sources like hospital records, open-source datasets, etc.

b. Data Cleaning

It involves detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records, dealing with missing values, duplicates, and invalid data types.

c. Data Integration

Combining data from multiple sources (e.g., lab results + patient info) into a unified view.

d. Data Transformation

Transforming the data into appropriate formats, scaling, encoding, and creating new features suitable for analysis or machine learning models.
